This is a big modules containing a bunch of other sub modules:
- Room
- Activities
- AcitivityLog
- RoomBouncer

In addition it also makes a lot of use of PeerProvider as logically is related to it.

This cohesiveness isn't yet shown in Redux as all of the submodules above and the PeerProvider
keep their own root state. I believe it's worth bringing them all together as much as possible
without having to keep weird synch mechanisms, like the "useJoinedRoom" or a bunch of others
